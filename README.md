# RDS Backup

This gem backs up RDS databases to different cloud providers, granting an extra level of mind peacefulness.

## Installation

`rds_backup` should be run as a command line tool, so it makes sense to install it globally

```bash
$ gem install rds_backup
```

## Usage

`rds_backup` expects a `config.yml` file on the folder it is run, [here is a sample](config.yml.sample).

Currently, you need a Google Cloud account with access to Cloud Storage. Sign up [here](https://developers.google.com/storage/docs/signup?csw=1) and get your credentials [here](https://storage.cloud.google.com/m) under the section "Interoperable Access".

AWS credentials with access to SES and a Hipchat Room token from API v2 are also required at this time.

Then, simply run the gem's binary:

```bash
$ rds_backup
```

## Roadmap

* Tests
* Multiple cloud providers (we're already using fog)
* More yell adapters (Slack, Campfire, IRC, etc)
* More flexibe rules on backups to keep (Ã  la [ec2-expire-snapshots](https://github.com/alestic/ec2-expire-snapshots))
